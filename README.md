# Introduction

This repo contains everything needed to create a new app. Design system with Tamagui, expo-router, tracking third parties (AppsFlyer, PostHog) and monetization (Superwall).

## Customization

### Create a new repository

- create a new repository in GitHub
- add the following remote to your local repository: `git remote add <your-repo-name> https://github.com/nabil-ou/<your-repo-name>.git`
- push your changes to the remote repository: `git push <your-repo-name> main`
- check the remote repository for the new app: https://github.com/nabil-ou/<your-repo-name>
- clone this repo in your local machine: `git clone https://github.com/nabil-ou/<your-repo-name>.git`

You're all set. You should now have a new repository with the same code as this one, in a new repository, and a clone of the new repository in your local machine. 

Verification: You can edit the README.md and commit an push on the newly created repo.

(We do not use fork for this process because Github tries to sync the fork, and suggest PR from the fork to the starter repo)

### Configure the app

- find all references to `replace-app-name` and replace them with your new app name
